#Workflow
Here you'll find tips on how your workflow might work.

## Creating a new Mashup implementation



## Single Application Workflow (Team approach)
The Mashup can be used to build multiple applications into a single composite application or can be used to build a single application.

###To build a single application:
1 Download the zip file of the MashupJS from the following page, and unzip it.
- https://github.com/MashupJS/MashupJS

2 Copy the `app1` and `app2` folders from `Mashup.UI.App1` and `Mashup.UI.App2` to the `[root]Mashup.UI.Core/Mashup.UI.Core/src/apps/`

3 Do your normal "new project" type work

npm install
bower install

4 Execute your Gulp command.  Be sure to remove the `copyFromApps` task from Gulp.  You won't need this task if your application is totally self-contained.


## Composite Application Workflow (Multi-team approach)



## Adding an application



## Adding a new page/route



## Adding services and directives



## Keeping the Core up-to-date



## Managing custom code/styles



## Removing a Mashup appliation from your machine



## Using Gulp



## Using Source Control



## Configure and Publish



## Hybrid mobile applications
